node-cluster
============

In order to show how to implement a cluster in Node.js, I've doing a little tutorial.

You can see the tutorial in http://speakinbytes.com/2014/03/node-js-cluster/

To run this application, you'll need Node.js (0.8+ with npm).

Before running, dependencies should be installed with npm install.

Run the application with: node server.js.

Thanks and Enjoy!
